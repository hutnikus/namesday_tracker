## Simple app to show namesdays
As I haven't seen any namesday tracker on f-droid, I decided to make one myself.

## Future features
- multiple localizations
  - app text
  - name databases
- nicer UI (as of now, it is barebones)
  - widget size responsivity
  - app menu
  - multiple options
- settings
  - detailed color settings of the widget
  - enable/disable tomorrow's namesday

## Publishing
Eventually, this app should go on f-droid. It probably won't go on Google Play, as there's already plethora of namesday apps.
I just want one without ads, bloat and spyware.
